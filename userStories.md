Market Research Team

    1. As the market research team, I want easily identifiable and sellable products so that I don't have to spend more money on market research.
    2. As the market research team, I want products compared against one another so that the test participant can choose one over the other.
    3. As the market research team, I want no results to show before the end of the product choosing to keep the test sterile.
    4. As the market research team, I want to know not only what items were picked most, but what they won or lost to so that I can form product categories for specific buyers.

Developer
    1. As the developer, I want a customer that has a rough idea what they want and how they want it to work so that I can meet and exceed their expectations.
    2. As the developer, I want to make sure that I make a wireframe for the client prior to starting the build-out so that I can don't do the same work twice.
    3. As the developer, I want to make sure that I understand all the specifics about how the clients test is suppose to work so that I can make sure the data they receive back meets what was expected.
    4. As the developer, I want to make sure that I get money down on this project before committing to any work so that I don't do anything for free :).

Research participant
    1. As the research participant, I want to make sure that I am working with a user friendly application so that I can perform the test for the client.
    2. As the research participant, I want to clearly see all pictures of products being offered so that I can make a genuinely informed decision that can help the research team.
    3. As the research participant, I do not want to see the results of the previous comments so that I don't accidentally make bias decisions later.
    4. As the research participant, I want to make sure that the research team pays me before my work because the recruiter seemed really frugal when I signed up as a participant for the study.
